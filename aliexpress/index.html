<h1>Aliexpress shopping issues</h1>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>I ordered <strong>6 items</strong> (most not available locally), out of which <strong>3 have issues</strong>.<br /><strong>Total cost:&nbsp;</strong> <!--StartFragment--><span style="color: #ff0000;">AU$<!--EndFragment-->&nbsp;114.99</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Cost of disputed items:</strong>&nbsp; <span style="color: #ff0000;">AU$ 57.53<br />All items were bought for a friend and delivered at address in Wickham&nbsp;WA (not billing address).</span></p>
<ul>
    <li><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>Following item came with a damage.</strong></span><br /> <!--StartFragment--><strong>Product:</strong> AU$ 34.70&nbsp;<strong>Shipping:</strong> AU$ 0.00 <strong>Total:</strong> AU$ <!--StartFragment-->34.70<br />Base (Repair part) for Samsung laptop&nbsp;(&nbsp; <a href="https://www.aliexpress.com/item/new-Bottom-shell-for-SAMSUNG-LCD-15-6-NP700Z5-NP700Z5A-NP700Z5B-NP700Z5C-Bottom-case-Bottom-base/32807491638.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="color: #ff6600;">Product link</span></a>&nbsp; )<br /><span style="color: #ff0000;">Reason for claim:</span> Item was damaged. Seller didn't mention about the damage only that item has signs of use (2nd hand). However there are signs of damage in original listing image which you can only identify after looking at actual damaged item. I believe this falls in the <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>fraud</strong></span> category.<br /><span style="color: #ff0000;">Dispute proceeds:</span> Seller offered to pay for repair.&nbsp; However repair is not available in Wickham, cost otherwise is too high.&nbsp;&nbsp;Aliexpress&nbsp;dispute team&nbsp; arbitrated to offer no refunds or return.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><span style="color: #ff0000;">My point of view: <span style="color: #000000;">Dispute team didn't investigate. Even the&nbsp; Aliexpress general support agrees but nothing so far.<br /><img src="https://basghar.github.io/aliexpress/images/InkedP1020111_LI.jpg" width="286" height="161" /><br /></span></span></li>

I could not find a way, except for canceling and re-creating, which I wasn't sure about.&nbsp; Aliexpress&nbsp;dispute team&nbsp; arbitrated&nbsp; to <span style="color: #ff6600;">return goods (at buyers cost) and refund $12.05</span> with no options for me appeal on arbitration.&nbsp; I have contacted multiple times and having issue with support described at the end.&nbsp;<br /><span style="color: #ff0000;">My point of view:</span> Cheapest shipping cost from Wickham&nbsp;WA is nearly 90% of item and I should not be paying the shipping cost.&nbsp; Minimum $13.77.

<h2><span style="color: #ff0000;">General issue with Aliexpress&nbsp;support<br /></span></h2>
<ul>
    <li><span style="color: #000000;">Dispute team arbitrates&nbsp;without proper investigation and leaves no way to appeal or contact directly.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></li>
    <li><span style="color: #000000;">Solutions that are offered, are clearly infeasible.</span></li>
    <li><span style="color: #000000;">There is no way to contact dispute team directly.&nbsp;</span>General support is only accessible thru chat, no phone or email. They simply refuse to provide any contact details of the dispute team. I have not received any reply as promised by General support team.&nbsp;</li>
    <li><!--StartFragment--><span style="color: #000000;">I have been given 10 days <!--StartFragment-->(7 left)<!--EndFragment--> to return after which payment would be released to seller.&nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>
