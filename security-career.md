Hi 

Sorry for an invite. I am actually looking for some answers from people in cyber security. You can reply either on linked-in or at babarali@gmail.com. 

I am computer professional and in an age where next generation asks you questions regarding career choices and 
direction :) Obviously from me, often related to IT. A son of my friend wants to do undergrad in cyber security. I am however not sure if youngsters should make that choice right in the start unless they are confident of their natural talent and have exhibited it practically. In my opinion and experience, there is a considerable percentage of students in any course who are/remain average. Every field have different level of acceptance for the average. I know how it works for programming but not too sure about security. So here are some questions

- Is it a good idea to do a Bachelors of Cyber security course or is it better to do a general Computer Science degree with major potentially in security?

- I hear that the first job you get is more likely to be focusing on code testing and app support. The move into security comes more from how you position yourself after that start. What are your thoughts on this?

- I know that a general CS degree provide you a wide variety of choices in terms of fields within CS that you want to pursue. How do you think the choices are if a student have following degree.

- In software programming, there are still many opportunities for average programmers due to high demand in the field. I am not sure if cyber security offers the same?

I shall appreciate your input.
